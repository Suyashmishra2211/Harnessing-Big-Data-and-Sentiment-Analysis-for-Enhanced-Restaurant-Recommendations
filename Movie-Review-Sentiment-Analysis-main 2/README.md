# ENSF 612 Final Project - Movie Sentiment Analysis
For our final project in ENSF 612 - Engineering Large Scale Data Analytics Systems,
our team performed sentiment analysis on 50,000 movie reviews, from 
[Kaggle's IMDB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/sentiment-analysis-of-imdb-movie-reviews/data).
1,000 reviews were also manually added and labelled by our team.

## Methodology
* Our team used the PySpark library within Databricks. The notebook used for our project can be found in the file: [ENSF612_Final_Project.ipynb](ENSF612_Final_Project.ipynb).
* Our features vectors we tested included a bag-of-words model, a TF-IDF model, and a Word2Vec model 
* Classification models we tested included Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree Classifiers.
Our detailed report can be found in the file: [ENSF612_Final_Project_Report_GH_AL_JK.pdf](ENSF612_Final_Project_Report_GH_AL_JK.pdf).
